# Danmaku-Prototype

This is a working prototype for a top-down [danmaku game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danmaku).

It implements focused/non-focused speed, as well as a dash.

A short and rough video demo:

This project was expanded upon a bit in two other repos (due to differences in Unity version).

[`Danmaku-Prototype-2`](https://github.com/morgannewellsun/Danmaku-Prototype-2) implements more robust systems for joint-based animations, as well as for manipulating the camera and managing overall game systems.

[`Danmaku-Prototype-3`](https://github.com/morgannewellsun/Danmaku-Prototype-3) implements a framework for managing enemy attacks and behavior.
